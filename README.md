# education_feedback_sinatra_project

Educational Feedback is a project that attempts to bridge the gap between students and teachers (focusing on higher education) by giving students a way to give feedback daily. Students provide feedback after every class and teachers can see feedback accumulating throughout the semester.

Students can revisit their feedback, editing and deleting comments later.
All feedback has timestamps, which will allow future tools to be included in the web app, allowing teachers to analyze and reflect on their lessons and patterns within groups and in individual students.
In addition, future versions will allow students to be able to aggregate feedback for teachers in order to see how other students have described their classes.
